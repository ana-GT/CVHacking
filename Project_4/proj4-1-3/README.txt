Question 4-1-3
***************

1. Pair transA and transB: due to the translation between both scenes, there are corners that do not appear in transB respect to transA

2. Pair simA and simB: due to the similarity operation between both scenes, there are corners that do not appear in simB respect to simA

3. There are some points that are on edges and are not actually corners (on the guy's T-shirt or on the tree). 

4. Some points that in my opinion are corners do not appear! (for instance the corner of one of the columns in the guy's picture), also one of the square's corners in the robots's chest

NOTE: It is obvious I generated a small number of corners. This is due that otherwise my matches looked pretty bad. Varying the threshold and radius would increase the number of points, but these worked for me.
